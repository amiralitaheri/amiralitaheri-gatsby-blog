I have to have enough motivation and reasons, if there aren't any, I'm not that eager to spend my time on it. Don't get me wrong, if I'm promising you to do something, I will do that. Helping others is one of my passions, there were a lot of times that I ignored my own work in favor of doing something for a friend.  

As much as I love helping others, I need my own space. Working with peoples drains my energy, and I like some "Me Time" to recharge. It's a crazy paradox? Welcome to my life ðŸ˜Š. So as a friend you may see me disappear for a few days.  

I'm shy, it takes me a long time to break the ice, I'm working on that but let's be honest I can't change who I am.  

As for working, I am a rabbit rather than a tortoise. I'm working on this too, by committing to myself and trying to code every day. Still, if the work is something routine and repetitive, I get bored quickly and lose my interest.  

Besides programming, I'm interested in photography and psychology. And addicted to Dota2.  

Thank you for reading this "About Me" section, if you have any question, feel free to ask. Have a lovely day.
