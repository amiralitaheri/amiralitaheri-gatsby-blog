I tried many fields including Game Development, Back-End Development and Network. I think that I finally found the thing that I like. The joy and feeling that you get after turning a design to something alive are indescribable. And it easy thing to do, unlike the Game development, you could get your project up and running in less than two weeks.

The Front-end field is changing every year with a new frameworks and technologies, but after all these years of experience I feel comfortable tackling any challenge.
