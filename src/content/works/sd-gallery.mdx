Started as an MVP, [SD Gallery](https://github.com/amiralitaheri/sd-gallery) is software designed to view, search, and filter Stable diffusion generated image prompts.

The MVP was rejected, but it was a good project for me to experiment with Electron and Solid.

The source code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/amiralitaheri/sd-gallery).
