I started android app development by using Kotlin, and it's great but, I couldn't connect well with XML layouts, and I abandoned this field until I found Flutter. Dart is an amazing language, and Flutter looks a lot like react, so learning path was quite easy, there are a lot of things to learn, and I consider myself a junior developer in this field.
