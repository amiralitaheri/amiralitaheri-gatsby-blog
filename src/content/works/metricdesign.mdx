[MetricDesign](https://metricdesign.ir) website was one of my first projects. It uses The [Talos template](https://elements.envato.com/talos-creative-multipurpose-wordpress-theme-R75SUH),
 it has a dynamic gallery and uses [Filerun](https://www.filerun.com/) for file management. Today it has some SEO issues, but in general, it's fine.
 One of the things that I learned from this project was the fact that refactoring and redesigning a website is so tedious if you don't use components. So I started learning [React](https://reactjs.org/).
