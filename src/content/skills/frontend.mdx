I tried many fields including Game Development, Back-End Development and Network. I think that I finally found the thing that I like. The joy and feeling that you get after turning a design to something alive are indescribable. And it easy thing to do, unlike the Game development, you could get your project up and running in less than two weeks.

I consider myself a middle developer in this field, my solution may not be the best answers but they work.
